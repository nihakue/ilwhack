            <p>
                Undergraduate computer science student at Edinburgh University, interested in many computer-related topics and many more in "real life"!<br>
                I started playing computer games at an early age and grew tired of this around my 12th, after which I decided to make my own.

                Afterwards I grew interested in creating programs to work for me so that I have more time socializing and planning holidays to tropical places whilst the programs will finish my homework!

                Undergraduate software engineering student at the University of Edinburgh, with a strong passion for computers, cars, photography and nature.
I aim to bring creativity into everyday challenges. 

I enjoy jogging in the green as well as playing table tennis with friends.

In this project I designed and created the structure of the webpage.  I managed to successfully integrate PHP with Javascript. I used Javascript and JQuery to represent the data visually. I also found using the D3.js and Flop libraries very helpful.

               I am a third year visiting student from the US. I'm studying informatics with an emphesis in AI/Robotics, but I do as much as I can in as many fields as possible. The quickest way to learn about me is to check out my <a href="https://github.com/nihakue">Github</a> or my <a href="http://uk.linkedin.com/pub/gabriel-west/40/663/728">LinkedIn</a>.
               
               For this project, I acted as team lead, but worked mainly on the natural language processing side of things. I gained experience with BeautifulSoup for scraping, nltk for sentiment analysis, pos tagging, and other natural language processing, and Pymongo/MongoDB for the database.
               If you want to see how the sentiment analysis for MoodSP works, check out my <a href="gabe_dev.html">Dev Diary</a>
