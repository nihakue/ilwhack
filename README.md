MoodSP
=======

Project MoodSP: Track your MSP's mood in (nearly) real time. Get to know your MSP through data scraped from parliament and committee meeting transcripts, and analyzed using natural language processing techniques.


ILW Hack
-------------
MoodSP is the result of a weeklong hack at University of Edinburgh's [Smart Data Hack](https://comp-soc.com/ilwhack/ "ILWHack"). We were given seven days, and access to data from Open Data Scotland and others, to create some useful software

Use
-------------
MoodSP is hackathon code, and it's particularly hacky code at that. We hadn't envisioned anyone finding any use in this stuff, but if something catches your eye and you'd like to talk about using it just let us know. We'd be happy to clean stuff up.
